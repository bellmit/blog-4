### 1NF

schema is in 1 NF if there are no collection-valued attributes (sets, lists etc.);
in other word, each cell contains automic value. each cell has a single element and cannot be divided.


### 2NF
schema is in 2 NF if it is in 1NF and there are no partial functional dependencies from a candicate key to a non -key attribute.

没有 composite candicate key，自然就是符合第二范式了。

### 3NF
schema is in 3 NF if it is in 2NF and there are no transitive dependencies between non-key attributes.


### BCNF == 3.5NF

Boyce-Codd Normal Form.

A schema is in BCNF if it is in 3NF and the determinant of every non-trivial functional dependencies is a superkey.
